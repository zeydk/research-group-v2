This study analyzed Twitter posts related to vaccine hesitancy and its association with socio-economic variables in the US at the state level. The unique socio-economic characteristics of US states, such as education, race, or income, are significantly associated with attitudes toward vaccination. Our results indicate that vaccine hesitancy is a multifaceted phenomenon shaped by a complex interplay of factors. Furthermore, the research identifies two distinct sets of justifications for vaccine hesitancy. The first set pertains to political concerns, including constitutional rights and conspiracy theories. The second pertains to medical concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. However, vaccine-hesitant Twitter users pragmatically use broad categories of justification for their beliefs. This behavior may suggest that vaccine hesitancy is influenced by political beliefs, unconscious emotions, and gut-level instinct. Our findings have further implications for the critical role of trust in shaping attitudes toward vaccination and the need for tailored communication strategies to restore faith in marginalized communities.
