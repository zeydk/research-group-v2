abstract: "This study uses novel deep learning-based language models to extract
  meaningful information from vast chunks of textual data from Twitter on the
  competing narratives of the recent Syrian immigration to Turkey. Our analysis
  identifies five main topics in the framing of Syrian immigration in Turkish
  Twittersphere. In this paper, we demonstrate correlational links between the
  timing of landmark events and change in the percent share of trends in those
  topics across time. We highlight two important observations: (a) Social
  benefit demands of natives on Twitter rose sharply with the COVID-19 pandemic,
  leading to ever more widespread sentiments of welfare chauvinism and (b)
  Patriotic feelings and the implementation of an interventionist foreign policy
  agenda in the immigrants’ country of origin created a relatively tolerant yet
  patronizing attitude towards migrants. As the COVID-19 pandemic and
  immigration frequently occupy the center stage in politics of
  immigrant-hosting societies, our research has international appeal beyond its
  specific geographical context."
